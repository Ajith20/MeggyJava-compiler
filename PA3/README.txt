Notes about make:
We run our code in a Linux environment, so there may need to be changes to the Makefile depending on what testing environment you're using.

Our test cases:

PA2Test1.java -> empty statement program
PA2Test2.java -> setting pixels with constant integer expressions
PA2Test3.java -> setting pixels with color literals, setting pixels with byte casting
PA3Test1.java -> 
PA3Test2.java -> 
PA3Test3.java -> 
PA3CorrectTypes.java -> performs type checking on correct parameters for all PA3 grammar rules
PA3WrongTypes.java -> performs type checking on wrong parameters for all PA3 grammar rules
